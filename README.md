My first ever android project!
 

Hello, this is one of my first exposure to develop an application on android.
I built this with zero knowledge in android development prior to the making of this project.
The project's main purpose is to familarize myself with the development process.

It's a game (if you could call it that) that involves selecting other enemies that has a lower health than you.
If successfully done so, the hero's health will combine with the enemy's health, making you stronger.

Enjoy!
